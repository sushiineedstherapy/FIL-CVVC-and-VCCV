  For phoneme "r", or the rolled r, it is an allophone of "ɾ", meaning they are both the same sound but differ phonetically. The "ɾ" consonant is a tap, not a rolled r. It is found in many languages such as Japanese, Spanish, and Tagalog.
  For phoneme "3", or the "English r", they are commonly used in Tagalog when speaking English.
