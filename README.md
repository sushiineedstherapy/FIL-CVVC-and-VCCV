# FIL-CVVC-and-VCCV
Another Filipino reclist for the UTAU Software.

This repository contains custom made reclists by sushii-p, for Tagalog CVVC and Tagalog VCCV. However, VCCV reclists are still in beta. Keep in mind there will be errors you may encounter.

  For phoneme "r", or the rolled r, it is an allophone of "ɾ", meaning they are both the same sound but differ phonetically. The "ɾ" consonant is a tap, not a rolled r. It is found in many languages such as Japanese, Spanish, and Tagalog.
  For phoneme "3", or the "English r", they are commonly used in Tagalog when speaking English.
